## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and stability, aligning with the tech focus of the products sold.
- Background color: Light Gray (#EEEEEE), providing a clean and neutral backdrop that enhances readability and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: Amber (#FFC107), used for call-to-action buttons and highlights to draw attention to important functions without being distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) provides a balance of modernity and readability, suitable for both interface elements and longer text displays. Use 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for barcode display and any computer code in the repair tracking.
- Simple, flat icons representing product categories, payment methods, and stock management actions.
- A clean and organized layout that balances function and approachability. Ensure ample spacing and clear section dividers. The point-of-sale and stock pages must respond well to different screen sizes.
- Use animations for actions such as adding items to the sale and stock updates. The animations must be very brief so as not to interrupt workflow.
